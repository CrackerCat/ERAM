# ERAM

ERAM v2.30 is an Opensource RAM Disk made by Hideaki Okubo (okubo at msh.biglobe.ne.jp) with the source code comments translated by Katayama Hirofumi MZ (katayama.hirofumi.mz at gmail.com) and some modifications made by me thanks to help from a member of community.osr.com. It has a size limit of 4 GB that uses page/non-paged/external RAM. You can use it for storing temp files, browser cache, etc. in order to speed up the programs that use those files.

## Install Instructions
